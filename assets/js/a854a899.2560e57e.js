MockAI focuses on creating coding interviews that provide real-time feedback, allowing for performance analysis to help users improve their skills. Final Round AI offers a set of tools including real-time transcription and personalized support based on industry-specific scenarios. WhiteBoardFlow is different from these solutions because it will handle handwriting recognition, allowing the user to practice physically writing out their solutions which better simulates an interviewing environment. Whiteboard Assistant also utilizes speech-to-text technology to allow the user to practice the verbal aspects of an interview and explain their thought process."]})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},28453:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>a});var n=i(96540);const o={},r=n.createContext(o);function s(e){const t=n.useContext(r);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:s(e.components),n.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
