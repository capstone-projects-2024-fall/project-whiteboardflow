WhiteBoardFlow will additionally make use of artificial intelligence to review and give feedback on the user's work, as well as to give help according to the work the student has done so far.

MockAI focuses on creating coding interviews that provide real-time feedback, allowing for performance analysis to help users improve their skills. Final Round AI offers a set of tools including real-time transcription and personalized support based on industry-specific scenarios. WhiteBoardFlow is different from these solutions because it introduces features like handwriting recognition, allowing the user to practice physically writting out their solutions which better simulates an interviewing environment. WhiteBoardFlow additionally utilizes speech-to-text technology to allow the user to practice the verbal aspects of an interview and explain their thought process."]})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},28453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>a});var i=o(96540);const n={},r=i.createContext(n);function s(e){const t=i.useContext(r);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:s(e.components),i.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
