# Introduction

WhiteBoardFlow is a tool to help professionals and students entering the development workforce practice whiteboard-style interview questions. Our product will ask interview-style coding questions and prompt the user to reason out their solution through writing and speaking. It will then generate feedback based on the answers and thought processes to guide the user through the correct thought process to solve the problem. The user can then attempt the problem with actual code or using handwriting dictation to determine correctness, optimization, and efficiency and then provide the feedback.
