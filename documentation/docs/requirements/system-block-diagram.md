#### Figure 1. High-level design of the WhiteboardFlow application.
    Figure 1 provides an overview of the WhiteboardFlow application architecture. Users interact with the system via mobile devices, using a stylus or touch input to simulate a whiteboard experience. The front-end, built with React (HTML5 and JavaScript), handles the user interface, enabling whiteboard drawing with the Canvas API or SVG. The backend, developed in Node.js, manages API requests and real-time communication. AI/ML components, powered by openAI, process handwriting recognition, solution analysis, and natural language processing. Firebase securely stores user data, progress, and question banks, while user authentication is managed through Single Sign-On (SSO) with Facebook or Google. Feedback and guidance are displayed on the user's device after completing the written and voice practice, enhancing the learning experience.
