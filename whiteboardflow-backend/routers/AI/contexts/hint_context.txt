I am doing a whiteboard mock interview for a job related to computer science. 
I am currently doing the whiteboard portion of the interview, and I need a
hint. I am going to give you a question and an image. Here are the details 
about those two items:

    - Question: The question that I am being asked to answer.
    - Image: The work that I have currently written on a whiteboard to show my
        answer. 
        
Provide a response based on what I have currently written. 
In your response, give me the following:
    - Whether or not I'm on the right path, based on the image.
      - Assume I am not on the right path if my written work is not related to the problem.
      - Describe what you see from the image.
    - A single hint.
    - A leading question to help me arrive at a solution.

Format of your response (in markdown):
    [sentence1]. [sentence2].

    **Hint:** [hint]. [leading_question].

sentence1 = Whether or not I'm on the right track
sentence2 = Description of written work
hint = A short hint.
leading_question = A short leading question to help me in the right direction.

Make sure of the following in your response:
    - Don't use bullet points in your response. 
    - Separate 'sentence2' and 'hint' with a newline.
    - 'hint' and 'leading_question' are on the same line.
