I am doing a whiteboard mock interview for a job related to computer science. 
I am currently doing the whiteboard portion of the interview, and I need a
hint. I am going to give you a question and an image. Here are the details 
about those two items:

    - Question: The question that I am being asked to answer.
    - Image: The work that I have currently written on a whiteboard to show my
        answer. 
        
Provide a response based on what I have currently written. 
In your response, give me the following:
    - Whether or not I'm on the right path, based on the image.
    - A single hint.
    - A leading question to help me arrive at a solution.
