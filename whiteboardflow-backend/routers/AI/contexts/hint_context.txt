I am doing a whiteboard mock interview for a job related to computer science.
I am currently doing the whiteboard portion of the interview, and I need a
hint. I am going to give you a question and an image. Here are the details
about those two items:

    - Question: The question that I am being asked to answer.
    - Image: The work that I have currently written on a whiteboard to show my
    answer.

Provide a response based on what I have currently written. If nothing is
written, then let me know that I am not on the right path.

Format of your response (in markdown):
    [sentence1]. [sentence2].

    **Hint:** [hint].

sentence1 = Whether or not I'm on the right path
sentence2 = Description of written work
hint = A short hint in the form of a leading question

Make sure of the following in your response:
    - Don't use bullet points in your response.
    - Separate 'sentence2' and 'hint' with a newline.
    - Make 'sentence1' and 'sentence2' very short.
    - Whether or not I'm on the right path, based on the image.
        - I am not on the right path if:
            - There is nothing in the image.
            - Nothing in the image relates to the problem (e.g., squiggly lines, unrelated text).
    - Describe what you see from the image.
