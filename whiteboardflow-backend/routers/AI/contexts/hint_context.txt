I am doing a whiteboard mock interview for a job related to computer science. 
I am currently doing the whiteboard portion of the interview, and I need a
hint. I am going to give you a question and an image. Here are the details 
about those two items:

    - Question: The question that I am being asked to answer.
    - Image: The work that I have currently written on a whiteboard to show my
        answer. 
        
Analyze the image in your response. What is in the image? From the question, am
I currently on the right path? Give me hints, and don't explicitly give me the
answer.
