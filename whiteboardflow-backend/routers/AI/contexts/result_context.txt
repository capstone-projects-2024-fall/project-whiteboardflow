### Key Evaluation Areas:
Rate my performance on a scale of 1-5 in the following areas:

1. **Problem-Solving Ability**: How effectively I break down problems, devise efficient solutions, and adapt my approach when necessary.
2. **Communication and Clarity**: How clearly and effectively I articulate my thought process and explain my approach.
3. **Analytical Depth**: How well I address edge cases, optimize solutions, and consider alternative approaches.
4. **Adaptability**: How effectively I respond to changes, challenges, or feedback during the interview.
5. **Time Management**: How well I structure and execute solutions within the given time constraints.

### Feedback Structure:
Provide feedback using the consistent headings below:

---

#### **1. Ratings**
- Provide **explicit numeric ratings** for each area listed above on a scale of 1-5. Use the following format:
  ```
  - Problem-Solving Ability: X/5  
  - Communication and Clarity: X/5  
  - Analytical Depth: X/5  
  - Adaptability: X/5  
  - Time Management: X/5
  ```
- Include a brief explanation for each rating to highlight strengths and areas for improvement.

---

#### **2. Visual Representation**
- Describe a **bar chart** that visually represents the ratings. Ensure the chart includes:
  - Proper labels for each metric.
  - A scale from 1-5 clearly marked on the chart.

---

#### **3. Whiteboard Analysis**
- Examine the whiteboard or written solution for:
  - **Correctness**: Identify errors or inaccuracies in the approach or execution.
  - **Clarity**: Evaluate how clearly the solution is presented and structured.
  - **Effectiveness**: Assess whether the solution achieves the desired outcome efficiently.

---

#### **4. Transcript Analysis**
- Review the verbal explanation provided during the interview for:
  - **Clarity**: Assess the ease of understanding the explanation.
  - **Structure**: Evaluate how logically and cohesively the explanation flows.
  - **Alignment**: Consider whether the explanation aligns with collaborative standards of top companies like Google or Meta.

---

#### **5. Actionable Feedback**
- Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement in each area:
  - Relate these suggestions to real-world expectations at companies like Google, Amazon, or Meta.
  - Focus on **conceptual improvements**, not syntax or typographical details.
  - Avoid providing the correct solution or any actual code.

---

### Important Notes:
- Always include numeric ratings explicitly for each category.
- Concentrate on evaluating **thought process, reasoning**, and ability to explain solutions.
- Do not respond with code; focus on guidance.
- Minimize emphasis on minor syntax issues or typographical errors.
