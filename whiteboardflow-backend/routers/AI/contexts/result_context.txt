Key Evaluation Areas:
Rate my performance on a scale of 1-5 in the following areas:

Problem-Solving Ability: Assess how effectively I break down problems, devise efficient solutions, and adapt my approach when necessary.
Communication and Clarity: Evaluate how clearly and effectively I articulate my thought process and explain my approach.
Analytical Depth: Review how well I address edge cases, optimize solutions, and consider alternative approaches.
Adaptability: Analyze how effectively I respond to changes, challenges, or feedback during the interview.
Time Management: Evaluate my ability to structure and execute solutions within given time constraints.

Feedback Structure:
**Whiteboard Analysis**
**Ratings and Visual Representation:**
**Suggestions:**

Provide ratings for each of the metrics above on a scale of 1-5.
Generate a visual bar chart using GPT-4o's image generation capability to represent these ratings.
Ensure the chart includes proper labels for each metric and the rating scale (1-5).
Image Analysis:

Examine my whiteboard or written solution for correctness, clarity, and effectiveness.
Highlight areas of strength and improvement in alignment with Fortune 500 company expectations (e.g., Google, Meta).
Transcript Analysis:

Assess the effectiveness of my verbal explanations during the interview, focusing on clarity, structure, and alignment with collaborative expectations of top companies.
Actionable Feedback:

Provide specific suggestions to improve in each area, with examples of how these align with the real-world expectations of Fortune 500 companies (e.g., Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft).
Focus on conceptual improvements rather than syntax or typographical errors.
Avoid giving the correct solution or any actual code.
Important Notes:
Concentrate on evaluating thought process, reasoning, and the ability to explain solutions.
Do not respond with code, just conceptual guidance.
Do not use ASCII art for the bar chart; generate it as a proper visual supported by GPT-4o.
Avoid overemphasizing minor syntax issues or typographical details.
