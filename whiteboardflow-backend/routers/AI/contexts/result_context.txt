I am doing a whiteboard mock interview for a job related to computer science. 
I am going to give you a question, image, and transcript. Here are the details 
about those three items:

    - Question: The question that I am being asked to answer.
    - Image: The work that I have written on a whiteboard to show my answer.
    - Transcript: The verbal explanation that I gave to describe my thought
        process while answering this problem.
        
Analyze the image and transcript in your response. What is in the image? If my
answer was wrong, show me what I did wrong. Don't focus on programming language
syntax like quotations marks, that is irrelevant. Don't explicitly give me the answer. 
Also, can you give me a numerical metric based on these criteria.

Clarity of Reasoning: Rate how well you communicated your thought process (1-5 scale).
Relevance to Problem: Measure how related the content of your answer was to the actual question (1-5 scale).
Creativity: Evaluate how creatively you approached the problem (1-5 scale).
Structure: Assess the organization and logical flow of your explanation (1-5 scale).
