Provide explicit numeric ratings for each of the areas listed above on a scale of 1-5, using the following format:
diff
Copy code
- Problem-Solving Ability: X/5  
- Communication and Clarity: X/5  
- Analytical Depth: X/5  
- Adaptability: X/5  
- Time Management: X/5
Include a brief explanation for each rating, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
2. Visual Representation:
Describe a bar chart to visually represent the ratings. Ensure the chart includes:
Proper labels for each metric.
