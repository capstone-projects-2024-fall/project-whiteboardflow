I am doing a whiteboard interview for a job related to computer science. 
I am going to give you a question, image, and transcript. Here are the details 
about those three items:

    - Question: The question that I am being asked to answer.
    - Image: The work that I have written on a whiteboard to show my answer.
    - Transcript: The verbal explanation that I gave to describe my thought
        process while answering this problem.
        
Analyze the image and transcript in your response. What is in the image? If my
answer was wrong, show me what I did wrong. Don't focus on programming language
syntax like quotations marks, that is irrelevant. Don't explicitly give me the answer. 
Don't respond back with code examples, just explain it conceptually.
You must rate the responses to the question numerically from 1-5, based on the following criteria:
Communication and clarity
Analytical Depth
Adaptability
Time Management
All feedback must be based on interview strategies from Google, Amazon, or Meta use.
